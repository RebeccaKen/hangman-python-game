<br>
<b>The issue:</b>
<p>I discovered a bug in my code that resulted in print statements being printed multiple times in the terminal.</p>
<p>This bug was attached to the code in the while loop that checks if the player’s guesses matches the answer. </p>
<br>
<b>The resolution:</b>
<p>I resolved this bug by researching online. I eventually found some information of Stack Overflow on the nature of while loops.</p>
<p>The bug was caused by the loop repeating because it didn’t have a break. I inserted two breaks into the while loop and the issue was resolved.</p>
